It would be a cool thing to try to predict baseball game outcomes. 
1) scrape roster data, maybe from fangraphs or from statcast
2) get players wOBA for the last 3 years using a threshold to make sure that we don't try to incorporate parital or missing seasons.
3) weight the wOBA for recency against sample size. Will probably want to figure out how to play with those weights to see
